# Multi-Algorithm-Problem-Solving
This project, developed for CSE246: Algorithms at East West University, applies multiple algorithmic techniques to solve a real-life problem scenario. It helps Bill choose the maximum number of suitable malls and acceptable coins using Bubble Sort, the Greedy-based Activity Selection Problem, and Dynamic Programming-based Coin Change Problem.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- Helping Bill Gates to solve a real-life problem scenario.
- Bubble sort is used to sort starting, finishing time, and balance spent.
- The concept of the Activity Selection Problem (Greedy approach) is used in the project.
- The idea of the Coin Change Problem (Dynamic Programming) is used in the project.
- We can solve any critical problem with the help of Algorithm course knowledge. In this 
case, we considered the set of coins while selecting the activity. 

This project demonstrates how algorithms can efficiently solve problems using optimized and practical approaches.
