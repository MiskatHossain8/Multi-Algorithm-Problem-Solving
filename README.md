# Multi-Algorithm-Problem-Solving
This project, developed for CSE246: Algorithms at East West University, applies multiple algorithmic techniques to solve a real-life problem scenario. It helps Bill choose the maximum number of suitable malls and acceptable coins using Bubble Sort, the Greedy-based Activity Selection Problem, and Dynamic Programming-based Coin Change Problem.
